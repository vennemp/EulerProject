# EulerProject

Solving the different [Euler project](https://projecteuler.net/) math problems with different code languages in effort to bolster coding skills.

I will include powershell (my strongest language at the beginning), Python, and maybe javascript down the line.

Feel free to critique my code if there are more efficient ways to do something.
